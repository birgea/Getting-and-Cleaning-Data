Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
=========================

This GitHub Repository is used to host scripts and documents related to the "Getting and Cleaning the Data" Coursera Course.

The repository hosts two files related to the project:  
* run_analysis.R script
* CodeBook.md document

The "run_analysis.R"" script is used to create a didy data set out of the two data sets
with a number of Smartphones accelerometer and gyroscope sensors 
signals by appropriately grouping the data, assigning names to the activities
and creating descriptive column names. The resulting tidy data set contains
means of means and means of standard deviations for a set of signal
measurements grouped by activity and the subject who performed each activity  

The "CodeBook.md" document describes how the script should be used, what it does, how the output should be interpreted and provideds an explanation of the meaning of the variables names.
